# OnlyPets
[Check it out on Heroku!](https://onlypets.herokuapp.com/)

This is my final project for the ACC Software Developer Bootcamp. The task was to create a fully functional website utilizing authentication methods, databases, CRUD functionality, and responsive design. Along with the base requirements I also decided to use AWS S3 to store the images posted to the site.

Throughout this whole process I learned a lot, not just with how to code things but also the process of putting all the pieces of an app together. I was able to complete this task in about 3 months and I plan to continue to work on more functionality as time goes on.

### Backstory
OnlyPets started off as a joke when I started bootcamp. Since money wasn't exactly abundant in my life with being in school I would joke that I was going to go on OnlyFans and sell cute pictures of my two cats (who are featured on the login page). When it came time to start deciding what to do for my project I was having a really hard time trying to think of what I could make. As I was jotting down ideas I remembered the silly concept of OnlyFans for pets and thus, OnlyPets was born.
